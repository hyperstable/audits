# <br/> Low Findings

## [L-01] flashFee and flashLoan should revert if `token != address(this)` to comply with ERC3156

### Details 

According to the ERC3156 [spec](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3156) and reference implementation, `flashFee()` and `flashLoan()` MUST revert if the `token` is not supported. The current implementation of `flashFee()` and `flashLoan()` do not follow this recommendation and therefore not fully spec compliant.

### Recommendation

Update `flashFee()` and `flashLoan()` to revert if `token != address(this)`

### Remediation

Fixed as recommended in commit [5d5bace](https://github.com/hyperstable/contracts/pull/82/commits/5d5bace67875d15887d9379b2364239f187c4279)

## <br/> [L-02] 1% flashloan fee in inconsistent with vault fees

### Details 

Currently a fee of 1% is charged on the flashloan amount. This in inconsistent with the vault implementation as a user can deposit -> borrow -> repay -> withdraw for no fee at all. This make the flashloan a unrealistic alternative as it is always better to use an atomic vault loan instead. Given that a majority of AMMs support flashloans at swap fees (often as low as 0.01%), collateral for the atomic vault loan can flash borrowed.

### Recommendation

Reduce or remove flash loan fee.

### Remediation

Flashloan fee can be adjusted post deployment

## <br/> [L-03] `maxFlashLoan()` allows excessively large flashloans

### Details 

In the current implementation a user can flashloan up to `type(uint256).max - totalSupply()`. This is beyond the reasonable amount that any honest actor would use. Flashloans beyond a certain threshold no longer bring any additional opportunity to honest actors and only serve to empower malicious actors to exploit edge cases or liquidity pools. 

### Recommendation

Limit `maxFlashLoan()` to some configurable amount. A reasonable starting value would be $5M that can be increased over time as the TVL of the protocol.

### Remediation

Fixed as recommended in commit [a3ad597](https://github.com/hyperstable/contracts/pull/87/commits/a3ad597f8d35a54d00f5ab026705161669facc8d)
